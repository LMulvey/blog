It's been a long time and a ton has changed. I've been working as a full-time Developer for **Critical Mass** for over a year now and was promoted to _Senior Developer_ in February!
In short, things are going great, career is going well, everything went to "plan". I'll be trying to use this blog again to post reflections from work/personal projects, as well as talk about my
other newfound passionâ€“cycling. I've converted to a full-time cycle commuter, even biking all through the last winter, and I could never go back now! ðŸš²
