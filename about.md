I'm a Senior Web Developer with [Critical Mass](https://criticalmass.com). I'm active in the YYC Web Dev Community and a mentor/instructor with Lighthouse Labs.

I'm also an avid cycle commuter with a interest in social issues, civic design, and learning about how we interact with the cities we love. I'm semi-active on Twitter but don't follow me if you don't want to hear my opinions ✌🏻
